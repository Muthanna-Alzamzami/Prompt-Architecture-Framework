# Prompt Architecture Framework

## Overview

Prompt Architecture Framework is a comprehensive, production-ready framework for designing, implementing, and managing multi-layer prompt architectures. It provides standardized patterns, best practices, and reusable components for building sophisticated AI systems with consistent, high-quality outputs.

## Core Objectives

1. **Standardization** - Creating consistent prompt design patterns across projects
2. 2. **Scalability** - Building frameworks that scale from simple to complex use cases
   3. 3. **Quality Assurance** - Implementing rigorous evaluation and testing methodologies
      4. 4. **Reusability** - Developing modular, reusable prompt components and templates
        
         5. ## Key Features
        
         6. ### Multi-Layer Prompt Architecture
         7. - System Layer - Core instructions and system behavior
